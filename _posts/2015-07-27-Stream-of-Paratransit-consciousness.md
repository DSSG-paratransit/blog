I'm not a fan of walls, of all types - walls between people, nations, or personalities - and that is why my blog is mostly a stream-of-consciousness, very personal account of what is going on with our data science project. Buzzwords beware, because to me, they're a huge obstacle to more people being open to the big data-fication of our many public and private data outlets. The insights, the struggles, and the pretty diagrams - feel free to check them out!
