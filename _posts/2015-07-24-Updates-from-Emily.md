##Quick Link

###My blog can be found [at this page](http://emilydreu.weebly.com/blog.html). 
As of July 24th, we are in week seven. Week eight starts July 28th, and so on and so forth.

##Explaining my blog

If you take a look at my blog, you might start wondering, "Hey, what is this DREU thing?
Isn't this supposed to be done through the eScience's DSSG summer program?" 
You're correct, and although I am not officially a DSSG summer intern, I am a part of the paratransit team
and the DSSG program has graciously allowed me to attend all their tutorials and presentations. Technically,
I am here at UW doing computer science research under my mentor, Anat Caspi, through the DREU program. [DREU 
(Distributed Research Experience for Undergraduates)](http://cra-w.org/ArticleDetails/tabid/77/ArticleID/54/Distributed-Research-Experiences-for-Undergraduates-DREU.aspx) is a selective program that pairs up undergraduate student 
applicants with a faculty mentor from a research institution. My mentor, Anat, is the director of the TCAT center
here at UW and she is the project lead for the paratransit project that TCAT is doing in conjunction with eScience's 
DSSG program. So, as her student, Anat decided to put me on the paratransit project as the main part of my research for the summer.


As part of my requirements for my DREU, I must keep an updated blog about my research and what I have been up
to each week. I write daily updates that are just short snippets about what is happening with our project, so
you can keep up with what we're doing (through Emily's perspective) by checking out the link above. Please note
that I arrived here two weeks before the DSSG program started, so blog posts about DSSG related work start at 
[week three](http://emilydreu.weebly.com/week-three).
