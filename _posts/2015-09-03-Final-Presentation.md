On Thursday, August 20th 2015, the Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) teams presented their final project solutions and analysis to the eScience community and guests. Each team showcased impressive contributions from 10 intensive weeks cleaning, managing and wrangling data into shape for evaluation.

The Paratransit team's final presentation is <a href = "https://uw.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f762fd97-3088-0100-9a5f-d38811d166df" target="_blank">here</a>. We also want to acknowledge our teammates Emily and Valentina who were vital for the work we did this summer, but were unable to attend the closing ceremony.  

For further reading on the DSSG program, the <a href = "http://www.washington.edu/news/2015/08/31/uw-students-put-data-science-skills-to-use-for-social-good/" target="_blank">University of Washington</a> and <a href = "http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2015/08/24/budding-uw-data-scientists-use-their-powers-for-social-good/1/" target="_blank">Xconomy</a> wrote profiles of the DSSG program, incubator projects and fellows' day-to-day activities.

Next up for the Paratransit team

We're going to continue improving our algorithm, incorporating feedback from King County Metro and exploring additional analyses of the historical data with the skills we honed this summer. Throughout this program we've recieved support from individuals and companies (too many to name) that invested resources in preparing and exposing fellows to data science tools and background knowledge. We want to thank all the instructors, facilitators and organizations that contributed their time lecturing, administering workshops and engaging fellows. Lastly, we're incredibly appreciative to the eScience Institute (especially Karla, Micaela and Sarah) for inviting us to join this project and the dynamic daily environment they created in the WRF Data Science Studio.
