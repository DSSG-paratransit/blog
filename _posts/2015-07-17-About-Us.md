''I'm just excited to be here'' - my tagline. I'm a Master's student at UW in applied mathematics, and I'm big into this growing ''data science'' scene. I'm from the Chicagoland area, and I will be moving back in August! It's been a nice 18 months or so in Seattle, and my time at the eScience Institute has been formative, to say the least. Machine learning, data science, buzzwords galore, I'm trying to learn more and more every day, moving from the classroom to applied, industry-relevant data science.
    
Working with the gobs of historical Access rider data has been a little bit different than working with the clean, organized toy-example data I'm used to from grad school, but it has been a fun learning new tools to handle the data we've got. I am a big fan of doing a thorough literature review before tackling any new problem, and while there is a ton of relevant research out there, this problem is ever-so-subtly different than the wide body of paratransit solutions that we've been able locate.

Why I love working on the paratransit problem: we have an opportunity to build something from scratch that can potentially efficiently eliminate a considerable source of risk from King County's paratransit operations!
