This summer, I'm enjoying working with our team and building a solution to improve King County's Access
Paratransit Service. Our project has really pushed us to understand our data's 
strengths and limitations and how we can best analyze routing and costs related to service.
Our team and the broader eScience community have been great resources for learning
approaches, software and workflows for tackling data-driven problems. 
I'm a graduate student at UW with research interests in health development, residential mobility and urban demography.

''I'm just excited to be here'' - my tagline. I'm a Master's student at UW in applied mathematics, and I'm big into this growing ''data science'' scene. I'm from the Chicagoland area, and I will be moving back in August! It's been a nice 18 months or so in Seattle, and my time at the eScience Institute has been formative, to say the least. Machine learning, data science, buzzwords galore, I'm trying to learn more and more every day, moving from the classroom to applied, industry-relevant data science.
    
Working with the gobs of historical Access rider data has been a little bit different than working with the clean, organized toy-example data I'm used to from grad school, but it has been a fun learning new tools to handle the data we've got. I am a big fan of doing a thorough literature review before tackling any new problem, and while there is a ton of relevant research out there, this problem is ever-so-subtly different than the wide body of paratransit solutions that we've been able locate.

Why I love working on the paratransit problem: we have an opportunity to build something from scratch that can potentially efficiently eliminate a considerable source of risk from King County's paratransit operations!

As the only one on the team not officially associated with UW, I've really enjoyed spending my summer here in Seattle, but I do look forward to going back to my home institution, Cornell College, in Mount Vernon, Iowa at the end of the summer. I'm a rising senior, about to finish my undergraduate degree with a B.S. in Computer Science, and so tackling a Big Data project like ours has been incredibly informative and exciting for me. 

I thoroughly enjoy working in our collaborative, interdisciplinary team environment, and I feel like I have learned a lot this summer from my different team mates and the unique perspectives they bring to the project. Our topic of working to improve the paratransit system for King County has been fun for me because I know our work can make a real difference for all the bus riders in King County. Also, I love delving into all the complexities that are involved in working with their system, and trying to analyze and learn more about how it works.
